## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS


### What I learned

Learnt how to really use event listeners specific to form elements. This took me so long about 2 months, and really made me doubt if I was really learning.   
To be fair, I had other things I was working on that weren't coding related but I'm still beating myself up about it.  
I'm just happy to be done, and I hate that what I feel is relief more than happiness.
